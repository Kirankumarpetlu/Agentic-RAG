Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines. AI was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on making predictions from data. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning using neural networks with many layers.
